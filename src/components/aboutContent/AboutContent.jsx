                        <h2>Dear Travellers,</h2>
                        <p>Handcrafting trips of a lifetime. That’s what motivates me and our team — in our Srinagar Headquarters and around India — every day. We believe that every guest should have a trip of a lifetime. From the first year’s offerings of three regions in Jammu Kashmir and Ladakh, we now explore more than 8 regions in 6 states of India. Along the way, Snow Kashmir Holidays has become known as the Kashmir’s best Leisure and adventure tour company. Traveller’s choose us because we have a knack for helping them explore iconic places in new, better or more immersive ways We’ve been honored and humbled that others have seen the merit in what we do. Among other awards, our company has been named Excellent Tour Operator by Trip Advisor multiple times. At the end of the day, our team is fortunate to play the role of well- connected friend, linking our guests with our friends around the regions… amazing guides, artisans, hoteliers, restaurateur’s, naturalists, and too many others to list here. I invite you to experience North India particularly Ladakh & Kashmir with our family of well-connected locals, exploring the regions in style. Make this the year you enjoy a handcrafted trip of a lifetime. </p>
