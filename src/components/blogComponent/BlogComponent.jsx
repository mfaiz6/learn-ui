                            <p>Behind every successful person, there is one elementary truth. Somewhere, someone cared about their growth and development.

                                For all of us at Thrillophilia, it has, in one way or the other been our dynamic, vibrant, quick-witted and ever so supportive Abhishek Daga Sir. Whenever we think of a mentor or a guide, for us stands the image of one young man with a vision to revolutionize the travel industry and the heart to make the process a fun learning experience.
                                Right from the moment when he struts inside the office, the aura seems to get fresher altogether, obviously with the multidimensional human that he is, it doesn’t come off as a surprise to us.
                                On one hand he could have the most mind-bending criticisms for you or come off as a strict disciplinarian, on the other, he is the sweetest and the most adoring person you could have around.
                                We believe he has a Midas touch and his brain is just wired differently, that’s all, using more of its capacity than most of our noggins combined!
                                As we wish this amazing human being slash genius a very happy birthday,  we fondly remember and appreciate Sir not just for his advice and mentorship, but for his other character traits too, that we get to experience in bits and pieces throughout the day. With every interaction, we learn something new, something insightful and different.</p>

                            <p>An exceptional leader:
                                In the time spent together Girdhar says, "I've never met anyone like him. He has always treated me with respect and given me the space to make my own decisions, while at the same time guiding me and making me believe in myself". Never for once allowing us to get too complacent with our achievements, Girdhar mentions how even when criticizing or scolding us, he looks out for us- making us identify the problem and bring out the right way to solve it. </p>
