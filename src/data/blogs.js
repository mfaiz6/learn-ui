            "At Thrillophilia, two entirely different horizons of the travel scenario- the destinations of North-East India and Bali are led by a team of super energetic and efficient people. They are devoted towards weaving the best travel memories for travelers around the globe - be it the diverse beauty of North-East India or the ‘Land of Gods’, Bali. This team never fails to curate and deliver the most experiential trips for people. Starting off as a small team, this pack of now almost 40 people perform in varied roles of sales, business, or operations, but together, they craft meaningful stories and solidify our vision for the future of travel and experiences.",
            "Meet the team that has been constantly working hand in hand to take their category to the top, their dedication and hard work reverberating the love they have for these destinations and the shift they want to make from the conventional ways of traveling. They are the experts who guide each customer in their journey from the moment of planning to the end, ensuring that each booking is catered to with care and there is no gap between what is promised and the service given.",
            "Sayandeep Das and Shubham Jain are the two team leads who look after the sales and business development of North-East and Bali respectively. Sayandeep handles a team of 23 people while Shubham leads 13 people. Their role within the team is more than just training and coaching the members. With the team, they are constantly working towards making the destinations smooth-functioning. For our customers, the duo stands as the ideal travel experts with every little detail at their fingertips, and for the team, a go-to guide under any circumstances. Their story doesn’t just end in sales and business development. Since both destinations have very distinct operationality, each team has a designated operation team of its own.  Special mention should be given to Rahul Bhattacharya who ensures smooth execution of operations of the North-East while the Bali operation is efficiently headed by team lead Shubham himself. One of the other pivotal tasks of the team is to determine the needs of products among people and revamp them time and again. The team owes it to the hard work of Prajakta Vaishampayan who has been single-mindedly working towards striking the right itineraries and deciding on a suitable product line.",
            "The squad of North-East and Bali stand together as they coalesce into building a smooth ecosystem. Starting from sales of the destinations to operations and the product line, the team functions in a harmonious way and redefines what it means to work in synergy."
